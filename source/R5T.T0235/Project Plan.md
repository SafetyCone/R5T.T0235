# R5T.T0235
Repository-related types.


## How this library works

This library contains it's types in sub-type libraries.
This library references all of its sub-type libraries, to provide a single project reference import of all sub-type libraries. These can be later specifically selected by client projects for the specific sub-types they require.

* IHasX/IWithX framework interface types (ex: IHasRepositoryName:string) are in R5T.T0235.T000.
